# Sreamlit Using Langchain, Python and Streamlit

<p>
Thanks to the power of artificial intelligence, travel planning has never been easier.
</p>

<p>
In this post, we'll create a basic, but handy tool that leverages AI to generate travels suggestions based on your location and provide kind of places.
</p>

<p>
We'll create a Python application using streamlit, a popular library for creating interactive web applications. The app will incorporate features from the langchain library, which integrates OpenAI's language model capabilities, allowing us to generate text based on prompts.
</p>

<p>
Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.
